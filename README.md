# Chapter 2: Shell tools and environments

The material is based on the Repronim's teaching material, the [missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), and has been modified for the data science basics course at WCM.

### How to use as template:
1. Change the following variables in `_config.yml` file:
   - `title`
   - `repo`
   - `root`
   - `email` (you can leave Ariel's address here, if you want).
   - `start_time` : this is the start time in minutes since midnight. For
     example, 9 AM is 540 (60 * 9).

2. Edit the content in the `_episodes` folder, adding images (into
  `assets/img`), code (into `code`), data (into `data`) as needed. Pay
  particular attention to the following:

  - Sections should be named `01-first-part.md`, `02-second-part.md`, etc to be ordered in the schedule.
  - Edit the headers of each of your sections. Editing the duration of both `teaching` and `exercises`
  - Add coffee breaks into the lesson. This keeps the timing of each section
    accurate.
